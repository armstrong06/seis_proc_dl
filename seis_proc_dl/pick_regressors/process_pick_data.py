    Uniformly randomize's the start times to within +/- max_dt seconds of
    the trace center and normalizes the amplitudes to [-1,1].

    Parameter
    ---------
    X_in : np.ndarray
       The n_obs x n_samples matrix of observed time series.  By this point
       all observations have been uniformly resampled.
    time_series_len : integer
       This is the desired output length.  This cannot exceed X_in.shape[1].
    max_dt : double
       The maximum time lag in seconds.  For example, 0.5 means the traces
       can be shifted +/- 0.5 seconds about the input trace center.
    dt : double
       The sampling period in seconds.

    Returns
    -------
    X_out : np.ndarray
       The n_obs x time_series_len matrix of signals that were normalized to
       +/- 1 and whose start times were randomizes to +/- max_dt of their
       original start time.
    random_lag : np.array
       The time shift to add to the original pick time to obtain the new
       pick time.
